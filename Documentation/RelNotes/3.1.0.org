* Magit v3.1.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes

- The function signature of ~magit-completing-read-multiple~ was not
  compatible with that of ~completing-read-multiple~, so we deprecate
  it.  Use the improved ~magit-completing-read-multiple*~ instead.
  #4420

** Changes since v3.0.0

- Added new command ~magit-log-move-to-revision~.  #4418

** Fixes since v3.0.0

- Fixed ~magit-emacs-Q-command~ and ~make build~ for ELPA users.

- ~magit-blame~ didn't account for quoted file names when parsing
  output from ~git blame~.  #4400

- A regression in v3.0.0 prevented ~magit-bisect-run~ from executing
  ~git bisect run~ unless ~magit-bisect-start~ was called beforehand.

- ~magit-log-select-quit~ failed to call ~magit-log-select-quit-function~.
  #4423
