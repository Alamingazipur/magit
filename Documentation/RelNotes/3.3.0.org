* Magit v3.3.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes
** Changes since v3.2.0

- No longer automatically add ~--full-history~ when showing log for a
  single file that isn't being tracked anymore.  #4381

** Fixes since v3.2.0

- Make ~magit-branch-remote-head~ and ~magit-branch-current~ fall back
  to ~:inverse-video~ when the ~:box~ attribute isn't support, i.e. in
  a terminal.  If this change does not have any effect for you then
  your theme probably changes these faces and should stop doing so.
  #4206
